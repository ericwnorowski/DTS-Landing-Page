        <p>DTS Goalkeeping focuses on preparation in four different aspects of the goalkeepers game. The foundation of good goalkeeping 
            starts with technical perfection. Each repitition needs to be focused on with detail and attention because there is always 
            room for technical improvement. The second focus is tactics, an expansion of technique. Goalkeepers must have 
            discussions and think through game-like scenarios to improve soccer IQ. The third is game preparation, keepers are put into 
            a unique position because they need to come up with saves throughout the game. DTS makes sure keepers feel comfortable stepping 
            into their boots on game day. And finally training for the mental side of the game because the a positive and confident attitude 
            is intrinsic to their play.

          <h2>Technical Development</h2>
          <p>There is not a single goalkeeper in the world, not even professionals that have perfect technique. High level goalkeepers
              are constantly looking to improve their technique through repition and experimentation. New techniques are emerging 
              constantly from different corners of the world. DTS looks to push modern goalkeeping techniques to young keepers so they 
              can properly develop.
        </div>
        <div class="philo-item">
          <h2>Tactical Awareness</h2>
          <p>As important as technical sessions are, DTS feels that with each technical session, a tactical discussion around the topic 
              must follow. Getting young keepers to understand the importance of each action and developing general soccer IQ is a major 
              key to long-term success. DTS utilizes a variety of resources including video, demonstration, game film and more in order for
              keepers to visualize this information. 
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="philo-item">
          <h2>Game Preparation</h2>
          <p>One of the unfortunate parts of goalkeeping is game-time opporunities may not come frequently. Therefore when keepers step onto the 
              field they need to feel confident in their abilities. DTS helps to develop and instill this confidence by demonstrating
              pre-game warm up routines, routinely practicing distribution and commmunication, and encouraging fearlessness when in goal.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="philo-item">
          <h2>Keeper Mentality</h2>
          <p>Sometimes called the lonliest job in sports, goalkeepers are known to have a different mindset than the average soccer player. Often
              times we are throwing our bodies in the way of shots, diving in the mud and just exemplifying grit. DTS understands that not 
              all keepers naturally have these abilities, therefore we feel it is important to create a training atmosphere that encourages
              this type of mentality.
